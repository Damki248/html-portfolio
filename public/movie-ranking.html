    <h2>My top 3 anime of all time</h2>
<hr/>
        <h3>Dragon ball/Dragon ball Z/Dragon ball GT/Dragon ball Super</h3>
        <p>
            I mean, this has to be one of the anime on the list.
            Dragon Ball Z is a shounen anime series about Goku, a saiyan 
            warrior from another planet that protects the Earth from alien 
            enemies with his friends that happen to be his foes once. Gotta love
            the classics. You should watch it in the order that is written in the heading.
            ENJOY!!!!

        <h3>Naruto/Naruto Shippuden</h3>
        <p>
            Naruto is another shounen style anime that tells a story about a young ninja 
            who was one of the worst of them all but with his training and passion to 
            become a hokage he became one of the legends. Another great anime with a beautiful 
            story that needs to be watched.

        <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
        <p>
            Another classic. Tells a story about Eren and his friends who fight 
            against titans who want to destroy their city. It becomes more fun the 
            more you watch it.

    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
        <h3>Marvel Universe movies</h3>
        <p>
            I can't just pick one of them. There were many awsome movies. You just have to 
            watch them all so you can understand everything in the MCU because Marvel likes 
            to make a movie in 2023 that is closely connected to one that aired in 2014. Marvel is 
            better than DC :D.
        </p>
        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>
            I just love sci-fi (if you couldn't tell). This movie is just so beautiful. I am 
            fascinated with the story and everything about the time travel and other physics phenomena.
        </p>
        <h3>Rush Hour</h3>
        <p>
            This movies is a masterpiece. There are few movies I can say I laughed this hard. Chris Tucker 
            and Jackie Chan are a really good combinaton. I doubt you haven't watch it, but if you didn't, it's 
            about 2 cops that try to reveal and stop a chinese mafia in USA.
